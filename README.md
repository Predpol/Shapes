# Shapes

This is a simple Ruby Gem for reading and writing Shape Files. 

It does pretty much what we need it to do for Predpol, and not much else.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'shapes'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install shapes

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Contributing

If you use Ruby and need to work with ShapeFiles, consider contributing to the project.

The gem is based off this C code: http://shapelib.maptools.org, which has been modified slightly, but not changed in any major way.
Chceck out the documentation for that project to learn how to work with it.

If you want to make big changes, get in touch with me and I'll add you on as a contributor. I'm @omarqazi everywhere on the internet.

But if you just want to add something small or fix a bug:

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
